An Enhanced Denoising Algorithm for OCT Images Based on Statistical Characteristics Classification and Adaptive Iteration

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital tool in medical imaging, providing high-resolution cross-sectional images of biological tissues. However, OCT images are often degraded by speckle noise, necessitating effective denoising techniques to enhance image clarity. 
This paper introduces an enhanced denoising algorithm that leverages adaptive statistical characteristics classification to reduce speckle noise in OCT images. The improved algorithm employs a dynamic block division and adaptive thresholding based on image entropy and variance.
Additionally, it proposes an improved iterative backward projection strategy that utilizes statistical features extracted from the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to adjust the backward projection operator.
Rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art denoising techniques, effectively reducing noise while preserving the structural details of OCT images.
